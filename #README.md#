process umi/barcode
----------

INPUT: fastq.gz
OUTPUT: data structure containing read ID, extracted UMI, extracted barcode

read structure

IIIIIBBBBBBNNNNNNNN... where I is random UMI sequence, B is pre-defined barcode, N remaining sequence

Loop through reads

In part defined from Islam, Nat Methods, 2014
1. 3' bases with quality of B are removed
2. Barcode extracted from 6-11 positions
3. UMI extracted, if any bases have Phred score <17, read discarded
4. Maximum of 9 G removed from 5' end or transcript (post barcode)

1.

2. Extract barcode
subset positions 6-11 from sequence
